## Description

```bash
This application utilizes the **inquirer package**, the inquirer package asks for the users input and excutes logic based on the users input. I was intrigued by what this package provides. I then installed the inquirer package and I applied the prompt method to display my questions to the user. Inquirer takes in a array of objects and inside the objects the message key it's value is what the user will be asked in the CLI.
