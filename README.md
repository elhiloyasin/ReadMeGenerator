 * This application utilizes the inquirer package, the inquirer package asks for the users input and excutes logic based on the users input. I was intrigued by what this package provides. I then installed the inquirer package applied the method that is used with package to ask the user the questions. ["inquirer.prompt"] which takes in a array of objects and inside the objects 3 properties and the message key it's value is what the user will be asked in the CLI.
